  "description": "Link workspace packages in monorepos (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun). USE WHEN: (1) you just created or generated new packages and need to wire up their dependencies, (2) user imports from a sibling package and needs to add it as a dependency, (3) you get resolution errors for workspace packages (@org/*) like \"cannot find module\", \"failed to resolve import\", \"TS2307\", or \"cannot resolve\". DO NOT patch around with tsconfig paths or manual package.json edits - use the package manager's workspace commands to fix actual linking."
