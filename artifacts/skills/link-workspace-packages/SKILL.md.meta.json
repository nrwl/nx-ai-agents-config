  "description": "Link workspace packages in monorepos (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun). USE WHEN user imports from a sibling package, needs to wire up dependencies between workspace packages, or gets resolution errors for workspace packages (@org/*) like \"cannot find module\", \"failed to resolve import\", or \"cannot resolve\". DO NOT patch around with tsconfig paths - fix the actual linking."
