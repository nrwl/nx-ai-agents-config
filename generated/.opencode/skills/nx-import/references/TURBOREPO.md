## Turborepo

- Nx can replace Turborepo task orchestration, but a clean migration still requires validating task mappings and project setup after import.
- Use the migration guide for the automated flow and config mapping details: https://nx.dev/docs/guides/adopting-nx/from-turborepo#easy-automated-migration-example
- Aim to remove turbo.json by merging all features into nx.json.
